-----------------------For displaying the library's GUI------------------------------

I am using Tkinter as well as ttkbootstrap for a better UI.
The ttkbootstrap library adds modern styling to Tkinter widgets and also has a wide range of themes
to choose from.

=> For the installation of ttkbookstrap:
-> pip install ttkbootstrap

Without ttkbootstrap, the library app won't run.



----------------------For extracting text from an image----------------------------

To identify (extract) text from an image in Python, you can use OCR (Optical Character Recognition).
The tool being used here is the Python library pyocr.

=> First, install pyocr and Pillow (for image handling):
-> pip install pyocr pillow

=> Then, you also need to install Tesseract OCR (this is the actual engine doing the recognition):
-> Installation guide here: https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Installation.html
